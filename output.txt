1|I do not have friends in?tennis, says Maria Sharapova|I think just because you're in the same sport doesn't mean that you have to be friends with everyone just because you're categorized, you're a tennis player, so you're going to get along with tennis players. I have friends that have completely different jobs and interests, and I've met them in very different parts of my life. I have not a lot of friends away from the courts.' So I'm not the one to strike up a conversation about the weather and know that in the next few minutes I have to go and try to win a tennis match. Maria Sharapova has basically no friends as tennis players on the WTA Tour. The Russian player has no problems in openly speaking about it and in a recent interview she said: 'I don't really hide any feelings too much. When she said she is not really close to a lot of players, is that something strategic that she is doing? Is it different on the men's tour than the women's tour? Uhm, I'm not really friendly or close to many players. When I'm on the courts or when I'm on the court playing, I'm a competitor and I want to beat every single person whether they're in the locker room or across the net.
2|Federer defeats Medvedev to advance to 14th Swiss Indoors final|Federer dominated the 20th-ranked Medvedev and had his first match-point chance to break serve again at 5-1. BASEL, Switzerland (AP) ? Roger Federer advanced to the 14th Swiss Indoors final of his career by beating seventh-seeded Daniil Medvedev 6-1, 6-4 on Saturday. Copil upset expectations of a Federer final against Alexander Zverev in a 6-3, 6-7 (6), 6-4 win over the fifth-ranked German in the earlier semifinal. He then dropped his serve to love, and let another match point slip in Medvedev's next service game by netting a backhand. Copil fired 26 aces past Zverev and never dropped serve, clinching after 2 1/2 hours with a forehand volley winner to break Zverev for the second time in the semifinal. Federer had an easier time than in his only previous match against Medvedev, a three-setter at Shanghai two weeks ago.
3|Tennis: Roger Federer ignored deadline set by 'new' Davis Cup|?I could not make a decision in that time, so I told them to do what they wanted.? The 20-time Grand Slam champion has voiced doubts about the wisdom of the one-week format to be introduced by organisers Kosmos, who have promised the International Tennis Federation up to $3 billion in prize money over the next quarter-century. This was designed for the future generation of players.? Argentina and Britain received wild cards to the new-look event, and will compete along with the four 2018 semi-finalists and the 12 teams who win qualifying rounds next February. Speaking at the Swiss Indoors tournament where he will play in Sunday?s final against Romanian qualifier Marius Copil, the world number three said that given the impossibly short time frame to make a decision, he opted out of any commitment. Roger Federer has revealed that organisers of the re-launched and condensed Davis Cup gave him three days to decide if he would commit to the controversial competition. Novak Djokovic has said he will give precedence to the ATP?s intended re-launch of the defunct World Team Cup in January 2020, at various Australian venues. ?I didn?t to have time to consult with all the people I had to consult. Federer said earlier this month in Shanghai in that his chances of playing the Davis Cup were all but non-existent. Major players feel that a big event in late November combined with one in January before the Australian Open will mean too much tennis and too little rest.
4|Nishikori to face off against Anderson in Vienna final|Kei Nishikori will try to end his long losing streak in ATP finals and Kevin Anderson will go for his second title of the year at the Erste Bank Open on Sunday. Anderson has a shot at a fifth career title and second of the year after winning in New York in February. Nishikori leads Anderson 4-2 on career matchups, but the South African won their only previous meeting this year. The fifth-seeded Nishikori reached his third final of 2018 after beating Mikhail Kukushkin of Kazakhstan 6-4, 6-3 in the semifinals. With a victory on Sunday, Anderson will qualify for the ATP Finals. Against Verdasco, Anderson hit nine of his 19 aces in the opening set. Currently in ninth place, Nishikori with a win could move to within 125 points of the cut for the eight-man event in London next month.
5|Roger Federer has made this huge change to tennis - Lindsay Davenport|?I felt like the best weeks that I had to get to know players when I was playing were the Fed Cup weeks or the Olympic weeks, not necessarily during the tournaments. ?Not always, but I really feel like in the mid-2000 years there was a huge shift of the attitudes of the top players and being more friendly and being more giving, and a lot of that had to do with players like Roger coming up. ?I just felt like it really kind of changed where people were a little bit, definitely in the '90s, a lot more quiet, into themselves, and then it started to become better.? Meanwhile, Federer is hoping he can improve his service game as he hunts his ninth Swiss Indoors title this week. ?Clearly you make your life more difficult, but still I was up 6-2, 3-1, break points, so things could have ended very quickly today, even though I didn't have the best serve percentage stats. ?I think there is a really nice environment and a great atmosphere, especially between some of the veteran players helping some of the younger players out. Federer, 37, first broke through on tour over two decades ago and he has since gone on to enjoy a glittering career. ?It's a very pleasant atmosphere, I'd have to say, around the locker rooms. The 20-time Grand Slam winner is chasing his 99th ATP title at the Swiss Indoors this week and he faces Jan-Lennard Struff in the second round on Thursday (6pm BST). Davenport enjoyed most of her success in the late 1990s and her third and final major tournament win came at the 2000 Australian Open.
6|Rafael Nadal: World No 1 ARRIVES for Paris Masters - WATCH|Nadal could then play defending champion Jack Sock in the third round before a potential quarter-final with either Borna Coric or Dominic Thiem. Nadal has not played tennis since he was forced to retire from the US Open semi-finals against Juan Martin Del Porto with a knee injury. British No 1 Kyle Edmund is the 12th seed in Paris and will get underway in round two against either Karen Khachanov or Filip Krajinovic. Nadal?s appearance in Paris is a big boost to the tournament organisers who could see Roger Federer withdraw. Federer?s projected route to the Paris final could also lead to matches against Kevin Anderson and Novak Djokovic. The world No 1 has been forced to miss Spain?s Davis Cup clash with France and the Asian hard court season.
7|TENNIS.COM PODCAST: POINT DEFENSE, RANKING DROPS AND ON-COURT COACHING|The end of the season is finally in sight, and with so many players defending?or losing?huge chunks of points in Singapore, Zhuhai and London, podcast co-hosts Nina Pantic and Irina Falconi discuss the art of defending points (02:14). Irina looks back at her WTA title win in Bogota in 2016, and tells an unforgettable story about her semifinal drama (14:04). He could lose 1,400 points in the next few weeks?but instead of focusing on the negative, it can all be about perspective (06:28). Nina and Irina give their opinions on what coaching should look like in the future, on both tours (18:55). It's no secret that Jack Sock has struggled on the singles court this year (his record is 7-19).
8|Tennis journalist?s heartbreaking insight on Todd Reid|?But my fondest memory is probably him coming back in Spain with his father and Todd trying to order a ham, cheese and tomato sandwich in the most Aussie English I ever heard.? Among his lesser known achievements - but even more significantto me - was an injured Reid?s effort to reach the final of the Manly Seaside, a prestigious Christmas-time event won backin the day by the likes of legends Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall, Frank Sedgman, John Bromwich, Lew Hoad, Neal Fraser, Fred Stolle, Evonne Goolagong and Australia?s last women?s Australian Open champion, Christine O?Neil. ?I was on a nice trajectorythen,? Reid recalled.?If I hadn?t got sick, I think I could have started pushing towards the second week at the slams and then who knows.? Duringa comeback attempt some five years later, Reid added Bernard Tomic and 2018 US Open Federer slayer John Millman to his list of career scalps. Fourteen years after sharing centre court with Roger Federer in the third round of the Australian Open, Reid was now running the counter and coaching kids - but sadly now never mine- in suburban Sydney at the Matraville tennis and squash centre run by his father Bob and beautiful mother Sandra, herselfa former professional. Exhausted after spending half his round deep in the bushes searching for my ball, as well as those of two other golfers he?d never met before, our incredibly giving designated driver asked if we didn?t mind going straight home after signing off so he could rest up a little before heading to work. With sponsors and the world at his feet, Reid was 14 then and being mentored by Nick Bollettieri, who fashioned the likes of Andre Agassi, Maria Sharapova, Monica Seles and Jim Courier into world No.1s. ?Now they won?t even give me tickets (to the Open).? A Davis Cup pick and on the cusp of the world?s 100 by 18, Reid had few other complaints - just a lingering sense of what might have been. ?Full effort Nick could live out his tennis like a (Tomas) Berdych or (Jo- Wilfried) Tsonga, consistently making second week,quarters, semis, finals of slams - and then hopefully more. Reid, too, was earmarked for the very top, only for injuries and illness to cruel his career. To Reid the 15-marker, just being up and at ?em was enough; a few bogeys and one well-made par ? broomstick putter and all ? vindication for his recent decision to renew his membership at nearby Bankstown. ?I was their golden boy then,? he said of his relationship with Tennis Australia. A big fan and believer in the enigmatic Canberran, Reid didn?t want to see Kyrgios?s career slip away like his did. The former Wimbledon junior champion was full of hope, excited about getting his life back together after a troubled few years and a touch-and-go battle with pancreatitis. ?I never got over what happened to me when I was 19,? he told AAP last week. Just as his senior career got legs, Reid was derailed by a debilitating bout of glandular fever. He?d backed up his last-32 showingat Melbourne Park with a string of wins over elites including French Open champion and then world No.9 Gaston Gaudio and Roland Garros runner-up Martin Verkerk in 2004 before illness struck. The life-changing setback hit only weeks after the then-teenage wonder boy announced his arrival as a grand slam threat by throwing up all over Rod Laver Arena during a fighting five-set second-round win over Sargis Sargsian.
